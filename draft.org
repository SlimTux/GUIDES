* Introduction
I choose this topic because a popular quote has always intrigued me "If life give you lemons, do a lemonade.", and also an internet experiment to power up a graphical calculator to play an old game [[https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-doom-running-on-100-pounds-of-moldy-potatoes/]["Using 100 pound of mold potatoes to run 'DOOM' (Video-game) in a graphical calculator"]]
 The reason I choose to use lemons and not other food, it is because lemons
are citric fruits. This type of food tend to output more energy than the average fruit. A popular choice to extract energy from food is the potato. I did not choose the potato because in my own opinion a lemon would be more inovative(There is a lot of experiences using potatoes, but few with lemons).

  Some issues I may find in my way, is to plot the experience's results
into GNUPLOT(The tool I choose to plot my data). Another issue I may find along my research it is the lemon's selection; The ideal lemon to lid the lightbulb
 Will a smaller lemon output more or less energy(It could provide more energy
than a bigger lemon, because the small one is more concentrated. But it could also just have less citric acid overall) to lid the lightbulb?
 How many lemons will it take for the first light to come out of the lightbulb?

 Thanks to my school's laboratory, I have all the necessary materials to (I hope) for a sucessful experiment.


* Materials
** Base
*** Lemon(s)
**** One Small and green
**** Standard green lemon
**** Standard yellow lemon
***** A standard lemon is
*** Lightbulb
** Laboratory
*** [[file:multimeter.jpg][Voltimeter/Multimeter]]
**** Measure the lemon's energy output
*** Alligator Clip
*** Wire + Galvanized nail
** Software
*** [[https://pranabdas.github.io/linux/gnuplot/][Gnuplot]] or "R-language"

* Approach
The mahtematical approach I choose is to graph the lemon's energy output over the time it takes (and remains) for the the light to stay on.

  I will also measure the lemon's voltage over time and the lemon's amperage.
 With the obtained data I will be able to do the mean of 5 lemons and their energy output against time.

 Considering the following formulae

* Considerations
[[https://blog.directenergy.com/back-to-school-beginner-science-experiments-electricity-part-1/][The average lemon output is .9 volts at .00024 amps — or about .000216 watt. It takes about four or five lemons to power a single red LED (1.5 volts).]]
